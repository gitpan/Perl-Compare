NAME
    Perl::Compare - Compare two perl documents for equivalence

SYNOPSIS
      use Perl::Compare;
  
      # Compare my file to yours, to see if they are functionally equivalent
      Perl::Compare->compare( 'my/file.pl', 'your/file.pl' );

DESCRIPTION
    Perl::Compare module takes perl documents, as a file name, raw source or
    an existing PPI::Document object, and compares the two to see if they
    are functionally identical.

    The two documents (however they are provided) are loaded into fully
    lexed PPI::Document structures. These are then destructively modified to
    factor out anything that may have different content but be functionally
    equivalent.

    At the most basic level, the non-significant Elements are stripped out,
    and some others converted into some lowest common form. Beyond that, a
    number of additional transforms are done, using a pseudo-plugin system.

    At the end of the normalization process, the two normalised documents
    are compared with a normal deep structu comparison.

METHODS
  compare $left, $right, option => value, ...
    The "compare" method is the primary method for doing a comparison
    between two Perl documents. It's provided with two arguments, and an
    optional set of options.

    Each comparitor can be either a PPI::Document object, a
    "Perl::Compare::_NormalizedDocument" object, a file name, or a reference
    to a scalar containing raw perl source code. Each comparitor will be
    loaded, parsed and normalized as needed to get two
    Perl::Compare::_NormalizedDocument objects, which are then compared
    using Data::Compare.

    The list of options will be documented once this module is actually
    useful.

    Returns true is the two perl items are equivalent, false if not, or
    "undef" on error.

  normalize $PPI::Document, option => value, ...
    The "normalize" method does the actual normalization of a single
    PPI::Document object. The method takes as argument a single
    PPI::Document object, and a set of options compatible with the "compare"
    method above, and returns a Perl::Compare::_NormalizeDocument object,
    which is the munged and destroyed result of the normalization process.

    Although primarily used internally, its main public use it to
    pre-normalize a Document object, when it will be compared a large number
    of times.

Perl::Compare::_NormalizedDocument
    Perl::Compare::_NormalizedDocument is the internal class used to flag a
    PPI::Document object as being fully normalized.

    It has no special properties, or methods (But its completely destroyed
    in the normalization process of course, so don't try to do anything with
    it).

TO DO
    Create a proper extention mechanism, document it, maybe autodetect
    plugins, and possibly break it up into multiple phases, so that the
    simple transforms can be isolated from the more complex ones.
